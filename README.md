#Android UDP Audio Chat Application

###What is it?

A simple UDP audio chat application for Android, developed for my final year university project.

This application is designed to allow users of Android devices to engage in audio conversations over a local wireless network. The application has the ability to discover other devices on the network which are currently running the application. Users choose a display name for their device which will be broadcast across the network and shown to other users who are currently running the application. Users can select one of the display names and attempt to initiate an audio chat session with the chosen device.

### Requirements

- At least API version 10 (Android version 2.3.3)
- A network that delivers UDP broadcast packets
- Currently, devices must be on the same subnet
